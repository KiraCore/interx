It ensures rapid, scalable queries and access to on-chain (SEKAI) and off-chain (L2) RollApp data without reliance on third-party RPC service providers such as Infura (Ethereum) and DA networks such as Celestia (Cosmos). INTERX streamlines the creation and maintenance of front-end and RollApp, eliminating the complexities associated with light clients and providing out-of-the-box support for sequencing, storage, fraud-proof generation, replication, proxy, and middleware layer load-balancing.
